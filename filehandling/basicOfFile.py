# The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
# The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
# There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:

# you need to specify entire path of file then you can access file else not

# "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

# "a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

# "w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

# "x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
