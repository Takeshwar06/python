# What about classes with child classes with the same name? Can we use polymorphism there?

# Yes. If we use the example above and make a parent class called Vehicle, and make Car, Boat,
# Plane child classes of Vehicle, the child classes inherits the Vehicle methods, but can override them:

class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Move!")

class Car(Vehicle):
  pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang") #Create a Car object
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747") #Create a Plane object

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  print(x.brand)
  print(x.model)
  x.move()
