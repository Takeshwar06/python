# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
# Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)


# 1 and True considered same value and also false and 0 

myset={1,True} #myset contain only one value because both are same for set
print(myset)
