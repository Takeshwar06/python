# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

# 'hello' is the same as "hello".

# You can display a string literal with the print() function:
# strings are immutable you can not change orignal string
a = "Hello"
print(a)

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])

# to find length of string
print(len(a))
